Hi everyone.
If you saw the last record, welcome back. I'm Yue.
Maki here
It's golden week! (Multiple bank holidays)
Why are you so excited?
What? It's one of the few times you can have a multipe day tour!
Well true...
Where are we heading?
We are heading to Nagasu port. There we'll catch the Ariake ferry to go to Nagasaki. 
It's pretty windy.
Yeah. I hope ferries are still running.
End of the uphill part?
Seems like it.
I think a great view is awaiting us.
The sea is pretty.
There is still time but I want to stop somewhere nice to get a picture. 
I hope so.
The clouds are leaving.
Yeah, there is even an angel ladder other there.
It's hard to take.
It's the light between the pole a your mirror.
I hope you can see it.
If you follow the light from the bright spot on the water it could be a bit easier to see.
Took a good picture, better than expected. 
Yeah, it was a great spot.
Well time to slowly go to the ferry.
There is still time so let's enjoy the view.
You're right. It could be the last time we see this scenery with this many clouds. 
Yeah, each time there is little changes so remember every scenery you see.
Well, it's our priviledge as inhabitants to see the scenery changing. 
Got to the ferry but it's delayed. 
There is still 2 hours before the next one.
It's better to wait rather than use the highway.
I'll have a nap then.
Wake me up in an hour.
Okay.
Maki.
You're awake?
Hmm.
It's already an hour?
Morning. Yup, we can board in 15 mins so we need to get ready. Well slept?
Wasn't bad. Okay, I'll prepare myself.
Here I come! 
There is still some wind so beware.
Glad not all ferries are canceled.
Yeah, it's your turn to rest.
You're right. I'll have a nap then. 
Boarding! 
Soon at the place we'll spend the night in. 
I've always wanted to go to that place.
Starting to see it but is it really ok? 
Yeah, I can see it too.
It's my second home so I'll show you arround.
Thanks. I hope there is still some private rooms open.
Feels like home!
There's not much time so going to sleep asap. 
Good morning.
Morning.
Today is another great day! 
Quarter past 5 is morning indeed but isn't it a bit early?
Want to get to the counter before it opens. 
Ferry?
Again?
Where are we going?
Still a secret. I want to check another place as well so leaving early. 
Fine...
The sun is slowly rising.
Indeed. The sun is slowly starting to raise up. 
You don't use the bypass?

Ah, I see well that's a fair point.
And I want to see the path I used last year with my bike. 
That's a good idea!
And want to check a secret place beforehand.
You like your secrets don't you.
We should arrive soon.
The sun is finally out. But where are we?
Wait a minute.
On the right you can see the entrance to a certain parking.

Oh, I'm excited!
Wait wasn't Nagasaki famous for its night view?
Yup, didn't expect you knew this.
Well, it's in the top 3 after all...
Was too famous I see. 
But you have never seen it right?
Nope I've never seen it.
Then you cannot look up for this place until we go, okay? 
Okay!
Speaking of internet, I'd like to know where we are heading...
I'd like to check beforehand for places to visit...
Hmm... I guess for the fist place I can say it. 
The first destination is...
Finally arrived!
Is this the boat we'll be using today?
Indeed. 
I'll go get tickets!
Yay. There still was some seats open.
I cannot belive you really didn't book it...
Yah. It's sad if your perfect plan doesn't go as planned.
You have a point...
What's fun traveling if there is no problems? 
Yeah, yeah.
You said we were going to Fukue island right?
Going to Fukue in the Gotō islands. 
Looks like it's a pretty place.
I'm really excited. Wanted to go here for seven years.
I bet it's a manga.
Yeah, Barakamon
Wait, this manga took place here?
You know this manga?!
Yeah, it was very fun!
Time to board!
I didn't expect the front to open like this.
First time I see a boat open like that.
Yeah. From what I saw, you go in from behind most of the time.
Boarding!
Don't slip.
Yeah, yeah.
Hi everyone.
If you saw the last record, welcome back. I'm Yue.
Maki here
We're heading to Fukue in Goto. We just got out of Nagasaki. 
I hope we can get find some where to sleep as well.
I'm sure it'll be all right. 
So this is the Megami bridge.
It's a huge bridge!
Right?!
I didn't expect the bottom to be like this.
I was expecting it to be more curved.
Maybe it's for the wind?
So the bridge doesn't rise_up in a typhoon.
That makes sense.
We are in the middle
Bye bye Nagasaki.
We'll be back.
Let the fun begin. 
Land! I can see land!
Land! I see land! Is that Fukue? 
I'm excited!
First destination, Fukue airport!
The first destination is an airport?
Wait there is no footage for when your going down the ferry?
Well... Kind of forgot...
Don't forget next time...
Okay...
Gotou go to Gotou! 
Oups... 
Well I can read goto as go to so...
Next is Onidake!
It's boring to go strait so let's go through this narrow road next to the runway. 
You sure you can go this way?
I'm sure it's okay. All road lead to Roma after all.
Yah... Well it's important to explore and have fun.
Indeed but cannot see planes from here saddly.
Hey!
Look forward!
I am looking forward.
Is that the parking for Onidake? 
Yue, quick!
I want to get to the top.
Yeah, yeah. Wait a second. 
The view from the stair is already great!
Still a bit cloudy. 
Oh! 
It's great.
We can see the port we came in.
I can see it too. 
As expected but cannot see our boat. 
Yah, but this place is more popular than expected.
Yeah... maybe we should head back? 
Time to go to the campsite I guess. 
Look Yue!
On the left, the sea!
I don't understand what you say. 
C'mon don't sulk.
I'm not sulking because I cannot show the side. 
Wait a minute... 
Oh! The sea is so pretty! 
This is take 2.
Noone would have known if you didn't say it... 
Hehe.
Now that the camera is on your helmet you cannot fall anymore.
I'll pay more attention. 
Got to the campsite! 
Wait your tent is already up?
Yeah... You didn't have to pitch you tent that far. 
It's not that far.
The preparation are mostly done... How about we have a walk around? 
Sure thing.
We are on the beach next to the campsite but what are those black rocks? 
Basalt maybe?
Indeed. 
The sea is so blue!
Indeed! The campsite on the southside is really great! 
It's so sad we're leaving tomorrow...
Time to make dinner.
You sure some instant noodles is good enough? 
Yah, people say instant ramens have a different taste outside.
Is that so? Cannot deny it tastes good. 
I'm surprised you use an alcohol stove.
Is it that unusual? 
Yah, it's dangerous if you flip it...
There is that risk and the heat is pretty weak. 
But this is a lot quieter and you can see remaining fuel. 
True. And I like that blue flame you cannot see under the sun.
Hehe, I like it too. 
Until the next record. Good night! 
Night night.
Good morning! 
Morning
Well slept? 
Yup.
You?
Well slept as well. 
Is there places you want to visit? 
I'd like to go to this place here... 
We can go there on our way back from the first destination. 
Good with me.
Cool. Let's dig in our breakfast and go. 
Okie.
Don't tell anyone I struggled to take down my tent.
I had no issues tho.
Lucky you. 
Well, now we are going around the island clockwise.
Let's enjoy! 
The scenery is great. 
Here begins the race to the westmost point of Fukue. 
There is a lighthouse at the end right?

The road is pretty easy to walk on.
Well it's a famous place after all.
It sure is fun to sightseeing by foot. 
You're surprisenly fit for a fatass. 
I'm not that... *out of breath*
We have been walking for 15 mins... Not yet arrived? 
Not yet.
Are we there? 
Not yet.
Soon right? 
Not yet.
Almost there mom? 
Not yet
I ain't your mother.
Hehe. But you do not seem tiered. 
Yeah
Oh! That view! 
It's great! 
This place is so pretty.
The lighthouse is in the frontline. 
The area is very pretty.
The cliffs are very pretty.
You just say "pretty". 
A pretty place is a pretty place.
A magnum lighthouse. 
Time to go back I guess? 
Yah.
The tip is windy, as expected... 
It's slowly clearing up but the rain from 2 days ago still is leaving some clouds behind.

Back to the motorcycle. 
For the next place we just have to go down this road.



I'm so excited!

Yup thank you.
Wanted to see a church in Nagasaki but this one is a bit special.
 Special? 
Here.
Here? 
Is it because Maria is in rocks? 
Wow you got it
This place is the first lourdes of Japan and the first church to be build out of bricks for this island.
Lewrd? 
Lourdes.
It's a place in France but it's a place where holy water comes from a grotto.
This is why a statue of Maria is stored in a grotto to keep the water clean.
I didn't expect a Lourdes to be in Japan so I was curious.
That's uncommon! 

Yeah.
Thanks for bringing me there.

Now what's the plan?

Scenery like this?

This place is great for enjooying the scenery.
Fukue was great! Whished we could stay one day longer. 
A beach... Hollow... 
Making a small detour.
kay


Fools and something goes up right.
Strong screenshake. 
GoProhadnopower. Theextrabatterieswerechargingbutthecablewasunpluged. 
You still have your phone.
You're not wrong but there is no stabilization... 
Why are we in this forest?

Don't break a leg.


Yeah, it's very nice!



Come to think of it this is your first forest track.

Ahh!
Did you get wet?
My feets got wet... 
Let's check once we're over. 
It's just water but better check ya.
How's the gravel?


Maybe change to second gear?
A bit too slow to put it on second. 
Be gentle on the throttle
I know!

Good things have an end...

This is so good!

Well you seem disapointed so knew already.

See you Fukue!

Maki here

Fukue was a great island.

What time will we arrive in Nagasaki?
Around 8pm? 
I'll have a nap downstairs then.
Ok. I'll stay here a bit to get used to the roll. 
kay, catch you later then.

Everyone want to see the view from this viewpoint.

Why use the elevator when you can use your feet?
I want to use the elevator... 
But I refuse.


You'll get used to it.
The staircase is long... 
Are youstill filming?
I think it's good. Don't want to check now... 
Hehe, I thought I could trick you to overpass you.
Meany! 
I won't let you! 
Hehe. I'm staying back to not get in the shot.
Why? 
Nothin'!
It's pretty crowded. 
An evening in one of the prettiest places in Japan, on a national holiday... That's to be expected...

Oh! Looks like a spot is opening up. 














The same place as last time?


It's already past noon mate.

We are heading south right?

Kagoshima...
Tomorrow is yet another ferry day! 
This leaves only a few options... Hope we're going to Tanegashima...


Okay, but remember that you are heavier with all your gear.


Yah, don't want to block the way.

There are stone on the road so beware.
Yeah, yeah! 

Soon at a border tho.
Cannot read yet. 
Satsuma? 
Satsuma, where Shimazu clan is from?
You know this?!
Me love my Drifters.

Wait, 5km downhill? 
Engine brake on a motorcycle is strong but don't go too fast.
Engine calm down. 
First time I hear it screaming like this too


Stay focused, you don't know what's coming.



But there are dead leafs.

Is that a hairpin ahead? 

Leaves, wet tire, hairpin...
But no oncoming car, lucky.
Ok, ok, ok. 
Goodgoodgood. 
Still up! 
Yatta_ze
Hop. 
Wide, flat, perfect. 
Hazard known as pedestrian appears.

That's where our leg will rest today. 
The entrance seems to be on the right.
Indeed, I think the end of the left side was for subs. Every other spot is open.
Okie.

Is the area in the back with yellow signs on the ceiling the space for regulars?

Morning!


I'm so excited to go to that place!
Hope there is still some seats open.
I'm sure it'll be fine. 
Hello, is there still some space? 
Sorry. We're full. 
Wha...
不要
不要
不要
不要
Hello, is there still some space? 
Sorry. We're full. 
Wha...
But there still might be some space for a motorcycle. Please wait a bit on the side. 
Okay, thank you.
