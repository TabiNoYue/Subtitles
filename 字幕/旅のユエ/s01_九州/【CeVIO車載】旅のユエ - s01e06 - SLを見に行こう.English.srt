1
00:00:11,459 --> 00:00:12,675
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:12,675 --> 00:00:16,259
If you saw the last record, welcome back. I'm Yue.

3
00:00:16,259 --> 00:00:18,309
Maki from prefectural road 25.

4
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:18,559
What?

5
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:20,859
What happened? Where is the camera?

6
00:00:20,859 --> 00:00:21,892
What do you mean?

7
00:00:21,892 --> 00:00:23,642
There is a camera in front of you.

8
00:00:23,642 --> 00:00:24,659
Yeah right...

9
00:00:25,159 --> 00:00:27,192
Where did you even learn to speak like this?

10
00:00:27,192 --> 00:00:28,075
Anything wrong?

11
00:00:28,075 --> 00:00:30,509
Nothing. It's just that you don't hear it much nowdays.

12
00:00:30,509 --> 00:00:33,109
I have a lot of text books and some DVDs.

13
00:00:33,109 --> 00:00:36,525
That's great. I didn't know such compilation existed.

14
00:00:36,525 --> 00:00:37,159
Yeah,

15
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:40,342
It was pretty hard a few years back but now it's a lot easier.

16
00:00:40,342 --> 00:00:42,559
It'd be great if there was the same for English.

17
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,259
By the way, how do you lookup for stuff?

18
00:00:44,259 --> 00:00:44,792
Hm?

19
00:00:44,792 --> 00:00:47,092
I just lookup for the latest manga and anime.

20
00:00:47,092 --> 00:00:47,892
Mangas!?!?

21
00:00:47,892 --> 00:00:50,842
Wait. Is there even untranslated manga other there?

22
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:53,409
There is a few but they are pretty expensive and rare.

23
00:00:53,409 --> 00:00:53,775
I see...

24
00:00:53,775 --> 00:00:55,492
You could do the same with comics...

25
00:00:55,492 --> 00:00:56,675
Comics are actually a good idea...

26
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:01,542
Welcome to Itsuki, the lullaby village.

27
00:01:01,542 --> 00:01:02,475
Lullaby village?

28
00:01:02,475 --> 00:01:03,959
Maybe a silent village?

29
00:01:03,959 --> 00:01:05,509
Silence with a motorcycle...

30
00:01:05,509 --> 00:01:06,459
I'm kind of sorry...

31
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:12,059
Oh, more cherries

32
00:01:12,059 --> 00:01:13,575
Most petals already felt...

33
00:01:13,575 --> 00:01:15,425
Well, we are a week late after all.

34
00:01:17,425 --> 00:01:22,609
I always heard hanami is short but didn't expect it was only 1 week with 1 or 2 weeks extra like this...

35
00:01:22,609 --> 00:01:24,825
Yeah, the rain makes them fall faster as well.

36
00:01:27,209 --> 00:01:28,609
Woah, that's a huge river

37
00:01:28,609 --> 00:01:29,342
Where's this?

38
00:01:29,342 --> 00:01:33,209
This is not a river. This is a dam lake. I think it was called Ichifusa dam lake.

39
00:01:33,209 --> 00:01:34,975
It's a great spot for sight seeing.

40
00:01:34,975 --> 00:01:36,559
First time but it's a nice place.

41
00:01:36,559 --> 00:01:38,042
No cars, great view.

42
00:01:42,042 --> 00:01:43,475
Once again on a narrow road?

43
00:01:43,475 --> 00:01:47,192
What do you mean again? As if I'm always running on narrow empty roads...

44
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:55,175
Well, cars coming from the front are scary, but many times it comes with a good view, feels like you unlocking new paths.

45
00:01:55,175 --> 00:01:56,309
Well, I mean.

46
00:01:56,309 --> 00:01:57,725
I like this kind of road.

47
00:01:57,725 --> 00:02:01,442
But you seem to be ultra focused on the road so I thought it made you stressed out.

48
00:02:01,442 --> 00:02:04,725
What? Really? I do have a lot of fun tho.

49
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:06,992
You sure? Don't push yourself too much ok?

50
00:02:06,992 --> 00:02:07,575
Yeah, yeah.

51
00:02:08,575 --> 00:02:10,709
But how about you? Not tiered?

52
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:11,525
Nah, I'm good. Thanks.

53
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:15,175
You sure? We do not take many breaks...

54
00:02:15,175 --> 00:02:16,442
Now it's not that hot.

55
00:02:16,442 --> 00:02:19,220
You make small stop here and there, so it's all good thanks.

56
00:02:19,225 --> 00:02:20,159
Don't push yourself.

57
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:21,125
Okey dokey

58
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:22,342
Hmm?

59
00:02:23,225 --> 00:02:24,975
Ahh, I want to go straight ahead!

60
00:02:24,975 --> 00:02:27,700
What? You don't have the skills to go on this kind of road yet...

61
00:02:27,709 --> 00:02:30,292
Yah... It might also be a private property...

62
00:02:30,292 --> 00:02:30,959
True...

63
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,642
Make sure to check beforehand.

64
00:02:32,642 --> 00:02:33,059
Okay.

65
00:02:34,225 --> 00:02:35,459
I want to go to a forest track one day...

66
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:38,092
Those kind of road won't run away so take your time.

67
00:02:38,092 --> 00:02:40,292
True. Let's go slowly at our pace.

68
00:02:42,909 --> 00:02:45,042
It's soon the end, want to go somewhere?

69
00:02:45,042 --> 00:02:46,692
Well, I don't really know the area...

70
00:02:46,692 --> 00:02:49,659
But I heard the road from Hitoyoshi to Ebino is pretty.

71
00:02:49,659 --> 00:02:51,409
Oh, that one. Sure thing.

72
00:02:51,409 --> 00:02:52,092
Thanks

73
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:57,059
The Hitoyoshi loop!

74
00:02:57,059 --> 00:02:58,142
That's a huge leap!

75
00:02:58,142 --> 00:02:59,509
Couldn't you have a larger view?

76
00:02:59,509 --> 00:03:00,592
Nope, sorry.

77
00:03:02,592 --> 00:03:03,275
Round and around.

78
00:03:05,275 --> 00:03:06,809
I'm starting to feel sick...

79
00:03:06,809 --> 00:03:07,059
What?

80
00:03:07,059 --> 00:03:07,475
Wait!

81
00:03:07,475 --> 00:03:07,892
Hmmm...

82
00:03:07,892 --> 00:03:08,509
How is it now?

83
00:03:08,509 --> 00:03:09,742
It's a bit better thanks.

84
00:03:09,742 --> 00:03:10,375
Glad to hear that.

85
00:03:11,392 --> 00:03:15,409
Maybe sit a bit on the left, make your body upright and have a flat sight?

86
00:03:15,409 --> 00:03:16,625
Okay... I'll try.

87
00:03:18,292 --> 00:03:19,642
We are about half now.

88
00:03:19,642 --> 00:03:22,159
Looks like there is an escape, want to stop?

89
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,692
I'm ok for now, thanks to the picture in center.

90
00:03:24,692 --> 00:03:26,042
Okay. Going on then.

91
00:03:27,342 --> 00:03:28,392
Oh on the bridge now?

92
00:03:28,392 --> 00:03:29,675
About 3 fifths?

93
00:03:31,175 --> 00:03:32,542
There is a nice view here.

94
00:03:32,542 --> 00:03:33,675
You're not wrong.

95
00:03:33,675 --> 00:03:35,875
Ah right, the camera can only point forward.

96
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:36,809
You're not wrong.

97
00:03:36,809 --> 00:03:38,559
Looks like we are coming to a strait?

98
00:03:38,559 --> 00:03:39,342
You're not wrong.

99
00:03:39,342 --> 00:03:41,192
Can finally look around a bit more

100
00:03:41,192 --> 00:03:41,925
You're not wrong.

101
00:03:41,925 --> 00:03:42,775
Are you okay?

102
00:03:42,775 --> 00:03:43,925
I'm totally don't feel sick...

103
00:03:43,925 --> 00:03:44,475
Really?

104
00:03:44,475 --> 00:03:45,292
I am, I am.

105
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:47,392
Just wondering how I'm going to shoot sideways.

106
00:03:47,392 --> 00:03:51,042
You can use a 360 camera, or put your GoPro on you helmet.

107
00:03:51,042 --> 00:03:52,309
Hmmm, I'll think about it.

108
00:03:57,775 --> 00:03:58,825
Soon out of the tunnel.

109
00:03:58,825 --> 00:04:00,492
I'm excited to see the other side!

110
00:04:01,275 --> 00:04:01,742
Ohhh.

111
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:01,975
Oh?

112
00:04:02,225 --> 00:04:02,592
Hmm.

113
00:04:04,642 --> 00:04:05,575
Look on the right!

114
00:04:05,575 --> 00:04:06,375
The right side looks great.

115
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:07,442
It's such a good view!

116
00:04:07,942 --> 00:04:10,259
By the way, didn't we cross borders once again?

117
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:11,159
You saw that?

118
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:14,659
In the tunnel there was a sign saying we entered Miyazaki prefecture.

119
00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:15,759
Don't you have a visual?

120
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:19,709
It was pretty shaky in the tunnel, but I found a nice snapshot.

121
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:21,242
Ah, I can read the sign.

122
00:04:21,742 --> 00:04:23,475
Is this the edge of Ebino city?

123
00:04:23,475 --> 00:04:24,842
This looks so peaceful.

124
00:04:24,842 --> 00:04:27,309
It sure is great to look down the view from a high place.

125
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:37,825
The southmost railroad crossing of Kumamoto!

126
00:04:37,825 --> 00:04:39,692
Actually you are back in Miyazaki.

127
00:04:39,692 --> 00:04:40,809
Wait? It is not?

128
00:04:42,592 --> 00:04:43,192
Making a small stop.

129
00:04:45,109 --> 00:04:48,009
There is a lot of grass on tracks, do trains even go here?

130
00:04:48,009 --> 00:04:50,092
Not used since the 2020 flooding...

131
00:04:50,092 --> 00:04:52,925
That's sad to hear... Hope it'll get back in business one day.

132
00:04:57,659 --> 00:04:58,642
We are almost there.

133
00:04:58,642 --> 00:05:00,625
I feel like I've seen this place before...

134
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:01,009
Is that so?

135
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,075
Can you say where we are?

136
00:05:02,075 --> 00:05:03,309
Here is Yatake station.

137
00:05:03,309 --> 00:05:05,040
I've never heard of this place...

138
00:05:05,042 --> 00:05:09,759
I think it's the southmost point of Kumamoto, but many come here for a different reason.

139
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:11,525
Ohhh!

140
00:05:11,525 --> 00:05:12,659
Is that a locomotive?

141
00:05:12,659 --> 00:05:15,242
SL Hitoyoshi, D51-170.

142
00:05:15,242 --> 00:05:18,292
It has been resting here since the 70' if I'm not mistaken.

143
00:05:18,292 --> 00:05:19,792
Mind if I take a closer look?

144
00:05:19,792 --> 00:05:21,542
Nono, take your time.

145
00:05:21,542 --> 00:05:22,309
Yay!

146
00:05:23,725 --> 00:05:24,709
It's a real one.

147
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,142
Can we go in?

148
00:05:27,559 --> 00:05:28,325
It's huge!

149
00:05:28,742 --> 00:05:31,125
There is a staircase and no forbidden mark...

150
00:05:32,542 --> 00:05:34,175
Yay, analogue meters!

151
00:05:35,225 --> 00:05:36,725
Is this where you throw coal in ?

152
00:05:38,725 --> 00:05:39,359
I'm back.

153
00:05:39,359 --> 00:05:39,909
Welcome back.

154
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:41,475
Hope you didn't wait too long.

155
00:05:41,475 --> 00:05:42,359
It's all good.

156
00:05:42,359 --> 00:05:43,225
Shall we go?

157
00:05:43,225 --> 00:05:44,359
Not taking a look at the station?

158
00:05:44,359 --> 00:05:45,409
I'll have a look then!

159
00:05:45,409 --> 00:05:46,292
Don't fall!

160
00:05:46,292 --> 00:05:47,225
Okay dad!

161
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:51,642
That station was a blast!

162
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:56,475
Yeah, it's very quiet but I hope that locomotive will stay there a bit longer.

163
00:05:56,475 --> 00:05:59,659
Yah, it's such a great opportunity to see that piece of history...

164
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:02,175
But sadly the paint is really coming into pieces.

165
00:06:02,175 --> 00:06:05,792
Well... It's free to visit so cannot really complain, can we?

166
00:06:05,792 --> 00:06:06,459
Yah...

167
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:08,259
You're turning here?

168
00:06:08,259 --> 00:06:08,875
Turning here.

169
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:11,909
I've seen a sign for station but going to another closed station?

170
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:12,592
Secret!

171
00:06:15,342 --> 00:06:17,192
I see a building. Is that the station?

172
00:06:17,192 --> 00:06:18,925
No, the station is a bit further.

173
00:06:18,925 --> 00:06:19,592
Wait...

174
00:06:19,592 --> 00:06:20,259
Is this?

175
00:06:21,259 --> 00:06:23,225
I'm sure I've seen this place before...

176
00:06:23,225 --> 00:06:25,559
You see it from time to time in videos from people going around Japan.

177
00:06:26,159 --> 00:06:27,559
God this is bugging me!

178
00:06:27,559 --> 00:06:29,609
I want to remember before finding the answer!

179
00:06:29,609 --> 00:06:30,225
Good luck.

180
00:06:31,359 --> 00:06:31,709
And...

181
00:06:31,842 --> 00:06:32,259
Five!

182
00:06:32,842 --> 00:06:33,259
Four.

183
00:06:33,842 --> 00:06:34,259
Three.

184
00:06:34,842 --> 00:06:35,242
Two!

185
00:06:35,842 --> 00:06:36,309
One!

186
00:06:36,842 --> 00:06:37,725
Time's up!

187
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:38,475
Ah!

188
00:06:38,475 --> 00:06:39,009
Got it!

189
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:43,192
Here we are at the business cards station, also known as Okoba Station.

190
00:06:43,192 --> 00:06:44,175
Isn’t that the other way around?

191
00:06:44,792 --> 00:06:47,275
Well, it is more famous the business cards.

192
00:06:47,275 --> 00:06:51,142
It's a shame because there is a switch-back over there but most come for the cards.

193
00:06:51,142 --> 00:06:54,292
Looking at the inside from here, I can only see talismans.

194
00:06:54,292 --> 00:06:57,209
Nah... It doesn't look like talismans... or does it?

195
00:06:57,209 --> 00:06:59,842
The owners of those business card will get angry at you!

196
00:06:59,842 --> 00:07:01,259
Hey! You were the one saying that!

197
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:06,092
There is so many business cards here.

198
00:07:06,575 --> 00:07:08,409
There is even some on the second floor.

199
00:07:08,409 --> 00:07:10,892
True! I wonder how they were able to stick them this high...

200
00:07:10,892 --> 00:07:12,809
Hope everyone did get a promotion...

201
00:07:15,192 --> 00:07:16,942
You didn't leave your card, did you?

202
00:07:16,942 --> 00:07:19,775
Hmm? I don't want to take space and want to do it myself...

203
00:07:20,259 --> 00:07:21,909
Come to think of it, how were exams?

204
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:22,692
Don't ask...

205
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:23,342
Ah, I see...

206
00:07:23,659 --> 00:07:25,909
Somehow managed to get in the top 10%...

207
00:07:25,909 --> 00:07:26,809
Wha? That's great!

208
00:07:26,809 --> 00:07:28,442
Exchange student I see...

209
00:07:28,442 --> 00:07:29,342
You're smart...

210
00:07:29,342 --> 00:07:30,825
Nah, I just study a lot.

211
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:33,409
I was always struggling to get a passing mark.

212
00:07:33,409 --> 00:07:36,125
Ah, that's why you use a motorcycle and not a car!

213
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:36,725
Yes?

214
00:07:37,709 --> 00:07:39,709
Apologize! Apologize to all motorcycle riders!

215
00:07:43,192 --> 00:07:48,525
Well I might be in top 10% for kokugo, but I'm worst 1% to understand Kumamoto's dialect.

216
00:07:48,525 --> 00:07:50,142
Smart-ass...

217
00:07:50,142 --> 00:07:52,959
But it is true there is not many references to learn those...

218
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:55,790
Yeah, there are not many books or ways to learn dialects.

219
00:07:55,792 --> 00:08:00,992
Nowdays there is videos on YouTube but they are very specific.

220
00:08:00,992 --> 00:08:03,275
I also found some websites for words.

221
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:03,875
Words huh?

222
00:08:05,425 --> 00:08:07,775
Dialects are fun to learn but hard to come by...

223
00:08:08,409 --> 00:08:10,842
Come to think of it you don't have a strong dialect...

224
00:08:10,842 --> 00:08:12,659
I see... Wait... You think so?

225
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,459
You don't say things like daken.

226
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:15,092
Daken...

227
00:08:15,092 --> 00:08:16,925
Well, it doesn't come out naturally.

228
00:08:16,925 --> 00:08:19,025
You had interest in dialect?

229
00:08:19,025 --> 00:08:19,775
A little bit.

230
00:08:19,775 --> 00:08:22,142
I love how each dialect is unique in Japan.

231
00:08:22,775 --> 00:08:24,142
Wait. This view is great!

232
00:08:24,142 --> 00:08:28,292
The sunset is pretty. It would have been better with some cherries.

233
00:08:28,609 --> 00:08:30,675
It's on the road leading the Okoba station.

234
00:08:30,675 --> 00:08:32,175
It must be hard if you are in a car.

235
00:08:32,175 --> 00:08:33,959
Good thing you're on a motorcycle.

236
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:37,009
Well, this kind of curve where you cannot see the other end is pretty scary.

237
00:08:37,009 --> 00:08:41,775
Yeah. You have to put your feets out and make it strait on halt when you're on a motorcycle ...

238
00:08:41,775 --> 00:08:42,442
Cannot hear you!

239
00:08:42,442 --> 00:08:44,109
There there, it's okay now

240
00:08:44,109 --> 00:08:44,725
Thank you.

241
00:08:48,725 --> 00:08:50,075
Time to go back to Kumamoto.

242
00:08:50,075 --> 00:08:51,542
This gates seens different.

243
00:08:51,542 --> 00:08:55,175
Here is an automated toll booth. You need a special etc card.

244
00:08:56,175 --> 00:08:57,992
First time I use one...

245
00:09:00,675 --> 00:09:01,325
Yay!

246
00:09:01,325 --> 00:09:02,759
This has a funny structure...

247
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:04,175
Bars on the right are shut.

248
00:09:04,175 --> 00:09:07,409
I think you go through here if you don't have the card...

249
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:13,625
Done with the 5th record...

250
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:15,525
I feel like it took you a bit less time...

251
00:09:15,525 --> 00:09:16,159
A little bit...

252
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:19,425
Well still a beginner but you seem to have found your way young man.

253
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:20,825
Nah, still have a lot to learn...

254
00:09:22,825 --> 00:09:26,409
Thank you for all the view and comments for the last record.

255
00:09:26,409 --> 00:09:29,775
Sorry for missing out the greeting at the start.

256
00:09:29,775 --> 00:09:31,942
Sorry, I was too excited about hanami...

257
00:09:31,942 --> 00:09:34,742
Greetings are important, but having fun is more important.

258
00:09:34,742 --> 00:09:35,525
Okay...

259
00:09:36,525 --> 00:09:39,159
There is some interesting comments from last record.

260
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:41,992
I wonder what people commented on.

261
00:09:42,492 --> 00:09:44,392
How did people find my birthday?!

262
00:09:44,392 --> 00:09:46,075
I didn't tell anyone!

263
00:09:46,075 --> 00:09:46,675
Really?...

264
00:09:46,675 --> 00:09:47,709
I wouldn't tell anyone.

265
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,425
But I don't get the first one?

266
00:09:49,425 --> 00:09:55,859
Hum? Ah, this is a well-used phrase and can be translated to "Yay! Maki is cute!".

267
00:09:55,859 --> 00:09:56,692
Is that so?

268
00:09:56,942 --> 00:09:59,309
The last one makes me really happy! Thank you!

269
00:09:59,909 --> 00:10:03,542
I'm really glad people don't find me annoying for not speaking japanese.

270
00:10:03,542 --> 00:10:07,509
Maki can speak Japanese but keeps speaking English to help me learn.

271
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:12,225
It's no biggy. I try to sound more Japanese and I feel a bit less homesick thanks to you.

272
00:10:12,725 --> 00:10:14,292
I really recommend that place.

273
00:10:14,292 --> 00:10:19,592
But since the road is narrow, beware of on comming cars. You can go early to avoid them.

274
00:10:19,592 --> 00:10:22,775
Yeah, we went twice but the second time it was very crowded.

275
00:10:22,775 --> 00:10:24,992
It gets crowded arround 10am.

276
00:10:25,492 --> 00:10:26,659
That place was also a good place.

277
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:28,692
Yeah, it was a very pretty good surprise.

278
00:10:28,692 --> 00:10:31,925
The road is new and straight so very easy to drive on.

279
00:10:31,925 --> 00:10:33,509
And very easy to look around.

280
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:37,159
Well next is everyone's favorite, long distance trip!

281
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:38,092
Golden week didn't happen.

282
00:10:38,659 --> 00:10:41,209
Ah... Wait, you came with me didn't you?

283
00:10:41,209 --> 00:10:42,292
You mean the exile?

284
00:10:42,292 --> 00:10:46,775
Yah, nah, I said exile a lot but we had fun right?

285
00:10:46,775 --> 00:10:47,359
Heh heh

286
00:10:47,359 --> 00:10:48,975
It was a lot of fun actually.

287
00:10:48,975 --> 00:10:49,425
I know right?

288
00:10:49,425 --> 00:10:54,809
For this reason we'll stop commenting on the previous video. We will reply once the trip is done.

289
00:10:54,809 --> 00:10:58,025
Sorry for breaking the format, but I hope you won't mind too much.

290
00:10:58,025 --> 00:11:00,892
Well see you on the next record until then take care.

291
00:11:00,892 --> 00:11:01,592
See you!
