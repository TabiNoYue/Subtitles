1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,750
This fiction contains the following elements.

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:07,700
Viewer discretion is advised

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:10,810
Greeting y'all

4
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:13,030
 I'll be the driver for this adventure. Call me Yue.

5
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:16,600
I'm Maki. Just freeloading Yue's motorcycle.

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:22,410
It's an unusual format with many flaws,  but wanted to log these memories.

7
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:27,800
Yeah, I might be an exchange student, but still unsure of my japanese.

8
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,330
I guess that's what makes the video odd...

9
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,430
No sweat, I can speak english for free after all.

10
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:38,580
Free? I won't speak if you don't show me around

11
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,510
Already going there myself so it's not a problem.

12
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,530
If you find the video too boring  or it doesn't suit your taste put a dislike,

13
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:50,380
Otherwise stick around until the end.

14
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:51,760
Wonder how you manage to say this.

15
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,060
Find it odd to say.

16
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,530
Wait? You don't have to say it?

17
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:56,110
Nope

18
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:58,500
Cute

19
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:33,360
Got my 2 wheel license!

20
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,730
Getting the motorcycle by the end of the month.    Can finally become part of the wind.

21
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:39,950
Oh, congrats. Going somewhere?

22
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:42,080
Didn't plan anything yet.

23
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:47,380
Can you give me a lift to the airport when I'll go back to sis' place by the end of the month?

24
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:49,680
Hmm, fine

25
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:58,910
Want to focus for the first few rides so ain't putting any action cam yet, but afterwards.

26
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:03,510
Actually you did wonder for a few on where to attach it and just gave up and left it home

27
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,010
You didn't need to tell them...

28
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:08,400
So enjoy this part with pictures only.

29
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:15,580
It's you first time editing so be carefull.  And no weird sentence or misspell.

30
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,430
Yah

31
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:21,700
Take care. Be carefull until you get home.

32
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,200
Thanks dad.

33
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:32,130
... Gotta get home too.  On way home I can make a small detour here and there.

34
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:47,110
このバイクの所有者ですか？

35
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,830
Is she talking to me?

36
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:51,650
どれぐらいのパワーありますか？

37
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:53,360
Ermmm...

38
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,230
えーっと、パワー、CC？

39
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:58,810
CC? Ohhh, 400

40
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:04,830
400CCは結構小さいね。でも見た目はごついね。

41
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:08,480
You've been riding for long?

42
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,360
About 1 month?

43
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:14,880
I've used one too. I must say I miss those days.

44
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,600
I see

45
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:23,800
Was fun talking to you. By the way your english is pretty good.

46
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,300
Nono still beginer

47
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:27,710
Have a good one mate.

48
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:28,800
Take care

49
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:38,480
Finally figured where to put this camera.

50
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,620
Hope it'll look good on the handlebar

51
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,010
Riding a motorcycle is great

52
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:57,210
I used to ride a bicycle but had a hard time climbing hills when I went from Kumamoto to Nagasaki

53
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:59,910
I can go anywhere with this

54
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:02,830
Made my heart of steel into a proper engine

55
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:07,460
Uphill hairpin incoming! Tilt...

56
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:13,280
Nailed it

57
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:26,510
Wasn't a mistake to choose the Honda 400x

58
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:29,810
Since it's an adventure bike, it's ready for adventure

59
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,030
Yay wind!

60
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:59,850
Crimson trees

61
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:15,410
Came at the right time

62
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,730
Pfiew, got on top. Didn't have any stall this time.

63
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:37,550
Phew, finally got on top. Why was that part a trail…

64
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,210
Ah
Ah

65
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:40,730
You are the dude of the other day.

66
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:46,300
You are the person of the other day...  Wait did you come here walking?

67
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,080
Yeah by foot.

68
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,860
Wow, you're very healthy!

69
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,850
I'm healthy?

70
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:59,430
Forgot to ask last time, when did you start using the motorcycle?

71
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:02,280
Around the start of October

72
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:07,180
Start of October? Wait, how far did you go in kilometers?

73
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:10,880
About 2800 kilometers? (2021/11/28)

74
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,910
What?

75
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:12,700
Something wrong?

76
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:16,900
Nope, not at all. Enjoy your pictures.

77
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:17,800
Thanks

78
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:22,660
Everyone has the same reaction...

79
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:25,600
Just riding 200-300km per ride

80
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,430
Up to 550km in 14 hours, 4 of which are used for resting...

81
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:35,400
Time to go home

82
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:04,480
Are your legs ok?

83
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,910
! You figured?

84
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:13,350
I'll figure a way. Going slowly down.  Maybe find a taxi in the worst case.

85
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:16,860
Want me to carry you?

86
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,850
You, motorcycle, to city.

87
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,030
M'kay, thanks for the lift mate.

88
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,550
Sorry but can carry the bag for me please?

89
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:32,330
OK, I can do that at least.

90
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,500
! Was this...

91
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,160
Ready?

92
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,430
No probs, let's go!

93
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:01,310
Dooooone

94
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:07,680
Perv... But yeah, now have to hope everyone will not hate it too much

95
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,010
We did our best

96
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:10,580
Yeah, we did good

97
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,750
Going to upload! 

98
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,860
「Hold me back!」 was it? (Untranslatable)

99
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,430
Why do you know this expression?

100
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:21,150
Just watching other's video

101
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:22,110
isthatso...

102
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:25,930
... From stupefaction I pressed the upload button... Que sera sera

103
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:27,400
Kesera Sera?

104
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,960
I think it ment something along the lines of "Things bound to happen will happen"

105
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:39,780
Well, time to make our next one. Where are we going next?

106
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,730
Please look forward to it

107
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:44,530
Anywhere you want to go, but I have already a few ideas

108
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:51,510
Since I need to edit and plan, I'll probably need roughthly 3 months

109
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:54,500
Booo, I'll help so make is faster.

110
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,750
I'm sure I'll find time between my classes.

111
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:58,630
Thanks

112
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:02,350
I hate old litrature and geography

113
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:06,730
I'll help... Wait I do not remember anything

114
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:08,960
I'll help for english

115
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:12,930
Gotta ask naration to Aoi later.
