1
00:00:11,459 --> 00:00:12,675
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:12,675 --> 00:00:16,259
If you saw the last record, welcome back. I'm Yue.

3
00:00:16,259 --> 00:00:17,025
Maki here.

4
00:00:17,025 --> 00:00:17,925
What's today's plan?

5
00:00:17,925 --> 00:00:19,059
Today we are going to Amakusa.

6
00:00:19,059 --> 00:00:21,242
Amakusa, Amakusa... Oh, I remember!

7
00:00:21,242 --> 00:00:25,359
A friend from school said she was often going there to fish. 
Are we going there to fish too?

8
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,059
Too bad! No fishing today. I've never fished anyway.

9
00:00:28,059 --> 00:00:29,792
You never did? Well, I didn't either.

10
00:00:29,792 --> 00:00:30,425
Why the taunt then...

11
00:00:30,425 --> 00:00:32,075
Today we are mostly riding on the coast line.

12
00:00:32,075 --> 00:00:34,059
And... I kind of want to take pictures somewhere.

13
00:00:34,059 --> 00:00:35,942
I'll wait or rather I'll walk around.

14
00:00:35,942 --> 00:00:38,492
Nono, I'll make it quick!

15
00:00:38,492 --> 00:00:40,559
It's fine. I want to walk around again.

16
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,692
Sorry. I'll try to be fast.

17
00:00:42,692 --> 00:00:46,075
It's ok. I'm sure it'd take me 3 or 4 hours just to get there.

18
00:00:46,075 --> 00:00:48,609
And you don't have to feel sorry about having fun.

19
00:00:48,609 --> 00:00:50,025
You're coming to have fun right?

20
00:00:50,025 --> 00:00:50,592
Thank you.

21
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:52,975
I'm having fun too so don't worry too much.

22
00:00:57,475 --> 00:00:59,125
Wasn't Amakusa on the sea side?

23
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:00,759
It is on the sea side.

24
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:02,575
I'm only seeing mountains for a few.

25
00:01:02,575 --> 00:01:03,109
Indeed.

26
00:01:03,109 --> 00:01:04,759
Hope you have a good explanation.

27
00:01:05,042 --> 00:01:08,675
Ahh, roads on Amakusa are often jammed so I go through a detour.

28
00:01:08,675 --> 00:01:11,575
You cannot see the sea here and when we'll cross the island.

29
00:01:11,575 --> 00:01:13,642
Is that so? Well, I'm enjoying the view.

30
00:01:17,142 --> 00:01:19,642
Oh! It's a bit far but is that the sea?

31
00:01:19,642 --> 00:01:20,292
You have good eyes!

32
00:01:20,292 --> 00:01:23,692
That land is Nagasaki so would that make the Ariake Sea?

33
00:01:23,692 --> 00:01:25,059
It's so pretty from here.

34
00:01:25,059 --> 00:01:27,392
Right? There is many viewing spot here.

35
00:01:29,392 --> 00:01:34,592
Like you said, no cars around. Just your motorcycle, sky, sea and the two of us.

36
00:01:34,592 --> 00:01:36,525
Maybe some animal is looking from between the trees.

37
00:01:36,525 --> 00:01:38,175
And maybe it'll jump across the road.

38
00:01:38,175 --> 00:01:40,492
Ahaha... Stop. You are making me scared.

39
00:01:44,992 --> 00:01:46,825
Oh?! We're almost at the sea.

40
00:01:46,825 --> 00:01:50,309
Really? I'm excited! I wonder if it's as blue as everyone says.

41
00:01:50,309 --> 00:01:53,142
Not sure about the colour but you can almost see it.

42
00:01:54,142 --> 00:01:55,025
Ohhh!

43
00:01:55,025 --> 00:01:55,792
Woaahh!

44
00:01:56,425 --> 00:01:57,359
You never saw the sea?

45
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:01,542
I've seen some inland sea but never a proper one. Didn't expect it to be this big.

46
00:02:01,542 --> 00:02:05,492
This is the Amakusa Sea. Since it's next to the East China sea, it seems endless.

47
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:06,659
Yeah, it's so huge!

48
00:02:07,492 --> 00:02:08,942
I wonder if we can swim here?

49
00:02:08,942 --> 00:02:12,442
I don't think so... there is a lot of current here.

50
00:02:12,442 --> 00:02:14,009
Is that so... it's a shame...

51
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:15,709
So many good roads to ride on.

52
00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:19,259
Too bad you cannot see places like this with public transport only...

53
00:02:19,259 --> 00:02:25,209
I might have said it earlier, but it really helps a lot because 
it'd take me 3 or 4 hours just to get here.

54
00:02:25,209 --> 00:02:26,025
That's hard...

55
00:02:26,025 --> 00:02:27,492
At least I can get here.

56
00:02:30,509 --> 00:02:31,892
The sea is really close...

57
00:02:31,892 --> 00:02:34,475
It is. This cliff sure makes the view better.

58
00:02:34,475 --> 00:02:36,192
I feel like I can almost touch it.

59
00:02:36,192 --> 00:02:38,225
Hey! Don't lean too much!

60
00:02:38,225 --> 00:02:39,775
Ow sorry! I'll be careful.

61
00:02:39,775 --> 00:02:40,559
It's okay.

62
00:02:45,059 --> 00:02:45,525
?

63
00:02:45,525 --> 00:02:46,042
What is?

64
00:02:46,042 --> 00:02:48,425
Feels like... It is a dead end... but not.

65
00:02:49,925 --> 00:02:51,275
Phew, it is just a detour.

66
00:02:51,275 --> 00:02:52,492
Glad it's not a dead end?

67
00:02:52,492 --> 00:02:56,242
Yeah. Since this is the only road, we would have to make a huge detour.

68
00:02:59,242 --> 00:03:00,759
The road is becoming narrower.

69
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:02,325
Bye-bye centre line.

70
00:03:02,325 --> 00:03:04,209
You're pretty calm. Aren't you scared?

71
00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:07,125
I'm uneasy thinking about oncoming cars, but that's why you lower the speed.

72
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:10,109
Is that so... I'm scared, but I love this kind of roads.

73
00:03:10,109 --> 00:03:11,809
It feels like it could lead anywhere.

74
00:03:11,809 --> 00:03:14,975
I get you. Feeling like it leads to some far far place.

75
00:03:18,475 --> 00:03:19,709
Sure is a good road.

76
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:22,409
Wait... a bus... here?!

77
00:03:22,409 --> 00:03:24,942
It's pretty narrow but nothing to be surprised at all.

78
00:03:24,942 --> 00:03:27,725
It has to go through small tunnels like the one in front.

79
00:03:29,325 --> 00:03:32,075
Wait... I cannot see incoming cars...

80
00:03:32,075 --> 00:03:34,409
Just be ready to stop and it's going to be ok.

81
00:03:35,542 --> 00:03:38,025
I cannot see... Hope noone is coming...

82
00:03:40,859 --> 00:03:42,359
Oh! We pretty high up.

83
00:03:42,359 --> 00:03:43,625
We have almost arrived.

84
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:44,225
Okie

85
00:03:48,225 --> 00:03:49,125
See you later!

86
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:49,975
Have a good time!

87
00:03:49,975 --> 00:03:51,975
Seizure warning for 10 seconds.

88
00:03:51,975 --> 00:03:53,359
Hope this setting is ok.

89
00:03:53,359 --> 00:03:55,325
Hop!
... I see...

90
00:03:55,325 --> 00:03:55,842
How about this!

91
00:03:56,092 --> 00:03:56,592
...

92
00:03:56,675 --> 00:03:57,292
Hop!
Yop!

93
00:03:57,292 --> 00:03:57,609
Yah!

94
00:03:57,609 --> 00:03:58,259
Ha!
*sigh*

95
00:03:58,259 --> 00:03:59,425
Mhhh
Not good either...

96
00:03:59,425 --> 00:04:00,292
How about this!

97
00:04:00,292 --> 00:04:00,942
Better.

98
00:04:00,942 --> 00:04:02,375
Why is he leaping about...

99
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:02,925
Nailed it!

100
00:04:04,275 --> 00:04:05,775
The view there seems good too.

101
00:04:05,775 --> 00:04:06,659
Wait, did Maki?!

102
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:07,675
It seems she isn't back yet...

103
00:04:07,675 --> 00:04:09,375
Just have to move the motorcycle over there.

104
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,942
Yup. Nice view. Perfect to wait for Maki.

105
00:04:13,942 --> 00:04:14,542
I'm back!

106
00:04:14,542 --> 00:04:15,909
Welcome back. How was it?

107
00:04:15,909 --> 00:04:18,692
Was fun. Not many viewpoints but the sea was cracking.

108
00:04:18,692 --> 00:04:20,742
That's good to hear! Ready to go?

109
00:04:20,742 --> 00:04:21,525
Let's go!

110
00:04:26,525 --> 00:04:29,142
I found a beach down there do you think we can swim?

111
00:04:29,142 --> 00:04:36,392
Got curious too and looked up and it is the Shiratsuru beach so I think you can swim.

112
00:04:36,392 --> 00:04:39,809
But, you've never seen the sea right?

113
00:04:39,809 --> 00:04:43,675
Never. I've been to pools and water theme parks but I've heard it's nothing like that?

114
00:04:43,675 --> 00:04:46,392
I don't like swimming per say, but I find it relaxing.

115
00:04:46,392 --> 00:04:49,759
I went to a water theme park once with friends and keep good memories.

116
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,025
Is that so? I'm not fond of the sea... Actually not fond of swimming in the sea.

117
00:04:54,025 --> 00:04:58,892
A pool is plenty to swim... But I'm interested in sailing and diving...

118
00:04:58,892 --> 00:04:59,742
Is that so...

119
00:04:59,742 --> 00:05:04,409
Ah, true. Going alone isn't fun. How about swimming with Aoi?

120
00:05:04,409 --> 00:05:07,042
There's a plane from Osaka to Amakusa.

121
00:05:07,042 --> 00:05:10,009
Wouldn't that make us need to ride the motorcycle with three persons?

122
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:12,959
It's going to be fine if you make yourself small.

123
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:14,892
Disclaimer: do not ride with three persons on the bike.

124
00:05:19,892 --> 00:05:22,192
But you'll have to wait alone while we're swimming.

125
00:05:22,192 --> 00:05:23,542
Don't worry about it.

126
00:05:23,542 --> 00:05:26,542
There seems to be a campsite nearby, so I'll enjoy myself there.

127
00:05:26,542 --> 00:05:29,942
You sure you don't want to come to the beach? You can see us in our swimsuits!

128
00:05:29,942 --> 00:05:33,142
It's ok. I'm happier if you two go along.

129
00:05:33,142 --> 00:05:34,375
I want to see!

130
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:37,842
Ok, I need to find a swimsuit first tho...

131
00:05:37,842 --> 00:05:41,225
I'm pretty sure there are 5 to 6 months until we can swim in the sea.

132
00:05:41,225 --> 00:05:43,059
You don't want to come and pick one with me?

133
00:05:44,059 --> 00:05:47,275
It's ok, it's ok. There's a lot of time to choose one.

134
00:05:48,075 --> 00:05:49,242
Cutie

135
00:05:54,242 --> 00:05:57,759
You said you wanted to try out something at the campsite but you like camping?

136
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,392
I have only camped once.

137
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:04,792
I slept a few times in a tent when trekking up the mountains but,
I've been told that's not camping.

138
00:06:04,792 --> 00:06:07,309
I'm surprised you even trekked in the first place.

139
00:06:07,309 --> 00:06:09,692
Trekking is fun since you can see a lot of pretty places from high up!

140
00:06:11,425 --> 00:06:12,192
High up...

141
00:06:13,192 --> 00:06:15,925
Ah, I remember something. Can we go to Amakusa's airport?

142
00:06:15,925 --> 00:06:19,359
Okay. It's a small shortcut but I hope the road is empty.

143
00:06:19,359 --> 00:06:21,325
Thanks I wanted to see that blue plane.

144
00:06:21,325 --> 00:06:22,059
You like planes?

145
00:06:22,059 --> 00:06:24,709
Not a huge fan but I find the small ones cute.

146
00:06:24,709 --> 00:06:25,525
Hope you can see it.

147
00:06:25,525 --> 00:06:28,592
Haven't checked the timetable. I'm pretty sure we won't be able to.

148
00:06:28,592 --> 00:06:30,075
We'll see.

149
00:06:34,075 --> 00:06:35,775
Hey, we are almost at the airport.

150
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,759
Here to the left.

151
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:39,442
Migi and Hidari... I always get confused.

152
00:06:39,442 --> 00:06:42,542
Used to say left then right so feel odd to say right, left...

153
00:06:42,559 --> 00:06:47,959
Ahh, I feel you. Left is the side you have your fork in... Who's left is it?

154
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:56,009
Or when driving in the city all day long you hear turn left, turn right, turn left, turn right, 
left, left, right, left... That's tiring...

155
00:06:56,009 --> 00:06:56,925
Yeah, I feel you...

156
00:06:56,925 --> 00:06:59,492
You always use the GPS? Why not turning it off?

157
00:06:59,492 --> 00:07:03,042
I'm starting to know the place so when not in a hurry I leave it off.

158
00:07:03,042 --> 00:07:04,275
You don't get lost often?

159
00:07:04,275 --> 00:07:08,259
I'm always left behind even if the GPS is right.

160
00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:08,675
Huh!?

161
00:07:08,675 --> 00:07:09,692
I'm sorry...

162
00:07:11,025 --> 00:07:13,742
Ain't a fan of word puns. Sorry for overreacting...

163
00:07:13,742 --> 00:07:15,175
No, my bad. I'll be careful from now on.

164
00:07:18,175 --> 00:07:18,842
Can you hear it?

165
00:07:18,842 --> 00:07:20,792
Yue, quick! We might have a glimpse of it!

166
00:07:20,792 --> 00:07:23,309
Go first. I'll find a place to stop the bike.

167
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:24,625
kay, I'm good with that!

168
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:30,892
You lucky there is a space to see the runway.

169
00:07:30,892 --> 00:07:32,809
I'm pretty excited to see it takeoff.

170
00:07:34,809 --> 00:07:36,375
Oh look it's going to fly!

171
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:38,109
It's gone.

172
00:07:38,109 --> 00:07:38,642
Indeed.

173
00:07:38,642 --> 00:07:40,759
Let's go back but want to go somewhere first.

174
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:41,775
I'll wait outside.

175
00:07:41,775 --> 00:07:43,392
Come, I want you to take a pic.

176
00:07:45,392 --> 00:07:49,042
It's unusual for you to take a pic. But I don't think there is anything in this direction...

177
00:07:49,042 --> 00:07:51,992
It's fine. Here we are. Take a shot around here.

178
00:07:51,992 --> 00:07:52,725
Here?

179
00:07:52,725 --> 00:07:53,975
Nahhh...

180
00:07:53,975 --> 00:07:54,892
Say cheese!

181
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:59,042
There is nothing to take here but is that ok?

182
00:07:59,042 --> 00:07:59,742
Perfect!

183
00:07:59,742 --> 00:08:01,559
Hope you'll get some comments from this.

184
00:08:01,559 --> 00:08:02,459
You sure know a lot...

185
00:08:07,009 --> 00:08:10,442
I'm sure there will be comments but don't want to leave that in the record...

186
00:08:10,442 --> 00:08:13,109
Hey, you should keep it. It's memories of stuff that happened.

187
00:08:13,109 --> 00:08:14,992
Ok ok, I'll leave it in.

188
00:08:14,992 --> 00:08:16,642
Just according to keikaku. 
Note: Keikaku means plan.

189
00:08:16,642 --> 00:08:17,375
Said something?

190
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:18,259
Nope nothing!

191
00:08:18,259 --> 00:08:20,692
Is that so? Time to go back to Kumamoto.

192
00:08:20,692 --> 00:08:21,459
Okay!

193
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:28,609
Ooyano flower road... wonder if it's good...

194
00:08:28,609 --> 00:08:29,809
It's pretty empty here.

195
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:31,959
The sun is in our back, so the shadows are long.

196
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:33,592
Indeed but I cannot look behind.

197
00:08:33,592 --> 00:08:35,375
Sure want to stop if there's a nice spot.

198
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:37,609
But it seems like there is no such spot.

199
00:08:38,892 --> 00:08:40,409
Amakusa... Wait a sec.

200
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:42,175
Amakusa-Style Remix of Church.

201
00:08:42,175 --> 00:08:45,525
Are there churches nearby? I thought Christians were many in Nagasaki.

202
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,925
They were mainly in Nagasaki but some Christian were in Amakusa too.

203
00:08:48,925 --> 00:08:50,675
If only I could remember earlier.

204
00:08:50,675 --> 00:08:52,675
It's okay. We can go next time since it's close.

205
00:08:52,675 --> 00:08:54,292
Yeah, if I can remember next time.

206
00:08:58,292 --> 00:09:00,709
Hope it wasn't too boring to be on the backseat all day long.

207
00:09:00,709 --> 00:09:05,275
Nono, you took me to the airport. 
And I could have walk when you were taking yourself.

208
00:09:05,275 --> 00:09:06,059
You saw that?

209
00:09:06,059 --> 00:09:08,309
Hehe, I chose the wrong path and came back.

210
00:09:08,309 --> 00:09:09,625
I did not notice it at all...

211
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:11,125
You were busy hoping around.

212
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:12,792
It's ok to drive all day long.

213
00:09:12,792 --> 00:09:14,659
I'm a bit jealous only you can drive tho...

214
00:09:14,659 --> 00:09:16,542
But at the same time I don't know much...

215
00:09:16,542 --> 00:09:20,609
Thinking of getting a bike lately... Go to close places by myself and far with you.

216
00:09:20,609 --> 00:09:22,509
A bike? Like a moped?

217
00:09:22,509 --> 00:09:24,092
Nono, a normal road bike.

218
00:09:24,092 --> 00:09:26,809
Oh, a road bike. I used to ride one back in the days too.

219
00:09:26,809 --> 00:09:28,992
Really? That's great. We can go together.

220
00:09:28,992 --> 00:09:29,592
Next time.

221
00:09:29,592 --> 00:09:31,942
I guess I will need to train again.

222
00:09:31,942 --> 00:09:35,509
But I don't have much pocket money atm. Will take a few to save up.

223
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:36,392
Just take your time.

224
00:09:36,392 --> 00:09:37,642
Phew...

225
00:09:43,409 --> 00:09:45,775
I feel like there was more internal thought this time.

226
00:09:45,775 --> 00:09:49,992
Sure. You said it'd be better to leave it in.

227
00:09:49,992 --> 00:09:50,859
Was that too much?

228
00:09:50,859 --> 00:09:53,825
Uzai... not sure of the meaning but I don't think it's annoying.

229
00:09:53,825 --> 00:09:57,559
That's roughly it. But that's embarrassing so don't want to use it too much.

230
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:59,659
Yeah, after all I can hear it all.

231
00:09:59,659 --> 00:10:01,475
Ah true that means Aoi...

232
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:02,342
Aoi!

233
00:10:02,492 --> 00:10:02,992
Yes.

234
00:10:03,142 --> 00:10:03,609
Yes.

235
00:10:03,609 --> 00:10:04,109
Yes.

236
00:10:04,209 --> 00:10:04,709
Sorry!

237
00:10:04,859 --> 00:10:06,709
No need to call the police!

238
00:10:07,092 --> 00:10:08,975
Wait. I'm underground but can you hear me?

239
00:10:09,292 --> 00:10:11,442
Huh? Hello? Hellooo?

240
00:10:11,442 --> 00:10:12,075
It cut.

241
00:10:12,075 --> 00:10:12,892
... hello? hello...

242
00:10:14,525 --> 00:10:16,092
And you wonder why she's nagging.

243
00:10:16,092 --> 00:10:17,425
I'll listen to the lecture later.

244
00:10:18,942 --> 00:10:20,959
Thanks for all the views and comments.

245
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:21,709
That's my line...

246
00:10:21,709 --> 00:10:24,175
Well, it's becoming a template so might as well.

247
00:10:24,175 --> 00:10:26,859
Template... It's true there isn't much change...

248
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:28,625
You should maybe think for another way?

249
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:34,075
You think? ... But I feel like thinking makes it sound fake.

250
00:10:34,075 --> 00:10:35,025
You're not wrong.

251
00:10:35,025 --> 00:10:38,475
Thank you for trying to make this a fun record.

252
00:10:38,475 --> 00:10:41,325
You don't have to say that while recording. You better cut that.

253
00:10:41,325 --> 00:10:43,192
Why? It's memories of events that happened!

254
00:10:44,475 --> 00:10:47,075
Don't spout nonsense and let's react to some comments!

255
00:10:47,075 --> 00:10:49,575
Indeed. Thanks for the comments.

256
00:10:50,075 --> 00:10:50,709
How's it?

257
00:10:50,709 --> 00:10:55,942
I'm not sure for others but since I already was I'll take it as a compliment.

258
00:10:55,942 --> 00:10:56,842
oh kay...

259
00:10:57,342 --> 00:10:58,609
That is a nice way to put it.

260
00:10:58,609 --> 00:11:01,075
It does fit pretty well. I didn't think about this.

261
00:11:01,075 --> 00:11:02,759
Thanks you for your interpretation.

262
00:11:03,259 --> 00:11:04,009
How's it?

263
00:11:04,009 --> 00:11:04,659
What's yan?

264
00:11:04,659 --> 00:11:05,809
It's about Yankees.

265
00:11:05,809 --> 00:11:07,075
I'm not an American...

266
00:11:07,075 --> 00:11:07,692
Wha?

267
00:11:07,692 --> 00:11:09,759
Ahh, this time it's for delinquents.

268
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:10,892
Are you a delinquent?

269
00:11:10,892 --> 00:11:11,625
Who knows?

270
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:15,142
To speak it's not that hard, but it is indeed tricky to write.

271
00:11:15,642 --> 00:11:19,742
Now need to compile the next record. But I think it'll take longer this time.

272
00:11:19,742 --> 00:11:21,575
Please look forward to the next record.

273
00:11:21,575 --> 00:11:23,192
Well see you on the next record until then take care.

274
00:11:23,192 --> 00:11:23,725
See you!
