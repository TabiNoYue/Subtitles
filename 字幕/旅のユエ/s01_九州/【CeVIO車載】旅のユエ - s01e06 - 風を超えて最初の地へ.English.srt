00:00:11,925 --> 00:00:13,142
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:13,142 --> 00:00:16,725
If you saw the last record, welcome back. I'm Yue.

3
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:17,525
Maki here

4
00:00:17,525 --> 00:00:18,842
It's golden week! (Multiple bank holidays)

5
00:00:18,842 --> 00:00:20,225
Why are you so excited?

6
00:00:20,225 --> 00:00:22,909
What? It's one of the few times you can have a multiple day tour!

7
00:00:22,909 --> 00:00:23,709
Well true...

8
00:00:24,042 --> 00:00:25,075
Where are we heading?

9
00:00:25,075 --> 00:00:29,692
We are heading to Nagasu port. There we'll catch the Ariake ferry to go to Nagasaki.

10
00:00:29,692 --> 00:00:30,725
It's pretty windy.

11
00:00:30,725 --> 00:00:33,125
Yeah. I hope ferries are still running.

12
00:00:35,175 --> 00:00:36,425
End of the uphill part?

13
00:00:36,425 --> 00:00:37,459
Seems like it.

14
00:00:37,459 --> 00:00:39,142
I think a great view is awaiting us.

15
00:00:40,142 --> 00:00:41,192
The sea is pretty.

16
00:00:41,192 --> 00:00:43,975
There is still time, but I want to stop somewhere nice to get a picture.

17
00:00:43,975 --> 00:00:45,975
I'm sure there will be a spot to stop.

18
00:00:45,975 --> 00:00:46,609
I hope so.

19
00:00:49,075 --> 00:00:50,575
The clouds are leaving.

20
00:00:50,575 --> 00:00:52,759
Yeah, there is even an angel ladder over there.

21
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:54,075
It's hard to take.

22
00:00:54,075 --> 00:00:56,342
It's the light between the pole and your mirror.

23
00:00:56,342 --> 00:00:57,209
I hope you can see it.

24
00:00:57,209 --> 00:01:01,209
If you follow the light from the bright spot on the water it could be a bit easier to see.

25
00:01:03,142 --> 00:01:04,942
Took a good picture, better than expected.

26
00:01:04,942 --> 00:01:06,542
Yeah, it was a great spot.

27
00:01:06,542 --> 00:01:08,325
Well time to slowly go to the ferry.

28
00:01:08,325 --> 00:01:10,609
There is still time so let's enjoy the view.

29
00:01:10,609 --> 00:01:14,992
You're right. It could be the last time we see this scenery with this many clouds.

30
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:18,775
Yeah, each time there are little changes so remember every scenery you see.

31
00:01:18,775 --> 00:01:22,975
Well, it's our privilege as inhabitants to see the scenery changing.

32
00:01:24,975 --> 00:01:26,992
Got to the ferry but it's delayed.

33
00:01:26,992 --> 00:01:29,175
There is still 2 hours before the next one.

34
00:01:29,175 --> 00:01:31,875
It's better to wait rather than use the highway.

35
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:32,942
I'll have a nap then.

36
00:01:32,942 --> 00:01:34,275
Wake me up in an hour.

37
00:01:34,275 --> 00:01:34,775
Okay.

38
00:01:37,775 --> 00:01:38,442
Maki.

39
00:01:39,442 --> 00:01:39,975
You're awake?

40
00:01:40,609 --> 00:01:41,192
Hmm.

41
00:01:41,192 --> 00:01:42,342
It's already an hour?

42
00:01:42,342 --> 00:01:46,725
Morning. Yup, we can board in 15 mins so we need to get ready. Well slept?

43
00:01:46,725 --> 00:01:49,025
Wasn't bad. Okay, I'll prepare myself.

44
00:01:51,025 --> 00:01:51,942
Here I come!

45
00:01:51,942 --> 00:01:53,709
There is still some wind so beware.

46
00:01:54,709 --> 00:01:55,875
Glad not all ferries are canceled.

47
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:57,559
Yeah, it's your turn to rest.

48
00:01:57,559 --> 00:01:59,342
You're right. I'll have a nap then.

49
00:02:01,342 --> 00:02:01,875
Boarding!

50
00:02:06,492 --> 00:02:07,959
Soon at the place we'll spend the night in.

51
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:09,942
I've always wanted to go to that place.

52
00:02:11,942 --> 00:02:14,159
Starting to see it but is it really ok?

53
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:15,692
Yeah, I can see it too.

54
00:02:15,692 --> 00:02:17,425
It's my second home so I'll show you around.

55
00:02:17,425 --> 00:02:20,259
Thanks. I hope there are still some private rooms open.

56
00:02:23,392 --> 00:02:24,075
Feels like home!

57
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:26,625
There's not much time so going to sleep asap.

58
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:29,909
Good morning.

59
00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:31,592
Today is another great day!

60
00:02:31,592 --> 00:02:34,559
Quarter past 5 is morning indeed but isn't it a bit early?

61
00:02:34,559 --> 00:02:36,925
Want to get to the counter before it opens.

62
00:02:36,925 --> 00:02:37,459
Ferry?

63
00:02:37,459 --> 00:02:38,042
Again?

64
00:02:38,042 --> 00:02:39,092
Where are we going?

65
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:42,392
Still a secret. I want to check another place as well so leaving early.

66
00:02:42,392 --> 00:02:43,042
Fine...

67
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:46,242
The sun is slowly rising.

68
00:02:46,242 --> 00:02:48,625
Indeed. The sun is slowly starting to rise up.

69
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:50,909
You don't use the bypass?

70
00:02:50,909 --> 00:02:56,192
There is still plenty of time. Normal roads should be empty. And that's a toll road...

71
00:02:56,192 --> 00:02:58,275
Ah, I see well that's a fair point.

72
00:02:58,275 --> 00:03:01,542
And I want to see the path I used last year with my bike.

73
00:03:01,542 --> 00:03:02,659
That's a good idea!

74
00:03:02,659 --> 00:03:04,742
And want to check a secret place beforehand.

75
00:03:04,742 --> 00:03:06,359
You like your secrets, don't you?

76
00:03:09,359 --> 00:03:10,309
We should arrive soon.

77
00:03:10,309 --> 00:03:12,375
The sun is finally out. But where are we?

78
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:13,192
Wait a minute.

79
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:17,325
On the right you can see the entrance to a certain parking.

80
00:03:17,325 --> 00:03:21,409
The parking of Mount Inasa Observation Deck. We'll come again once we're back.

81
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:22,492
Oh, I'm excited!

82
00:03:23,592 --> 00:03:25,875
Wait, wasn't Nagasaki famous for its night view?

83
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:27,459
Yup didn't expect you knew this.

84
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:29,525
Well, it's in the top 3 after all...

85
00:03:29,525 --> 00:03:30,959
Was too famous I see.

86
00:03:31,975 --> 00:03:33,359
But you have never seen it right?

87
00:03:33,359 --> 00:03:34,725
Nope I've never seen it.

88
00:03:34,725 --> 00:03:38,809
Then you cannot look up for this place until we go, okay?

89
00:03:38,809 --> 00:03:39,592
Okay!

90
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:45,425
Speaking of internet, I'd like to know where we are heading...

91
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:47,959
I'd like to check beforehand for places to visit...

92
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:51,092
Hmm... I guess for the first place I can say it.

93
00:03:52,092 --> 00:03:53,392
The first destination is...

94
00:03:54,392 --> 00:03:55,042
Finally arrived!

95
00:03:55,042 --> 00:03:56,709
Is this the boat we'll be using today?

96
00:03:56,709 --> 00:03:57,309
Indeed.

97
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:58,925
I'll go to get tickets!

98
00:04:00,925 --> 00:04:03,125
Yay. There were still some seats open.

99
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:04,959
I cannot believe you really didn't book it...

100
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,942
Yah. It's sad if your perfect plan doesn't go as planned.

101
00:04:07,942 --> 00:04:09,042
You have a point...

102
00:04:09,042 --> 00:04:11,725
What's fun traveling if there are no problems?

103
00:04:11,725 --> 00:04:12,342
Yeah, yeah.

104
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,042
You said we were going to Fukue island right?

105
00:04:15,042 --> 00:04:16,609
Going to Fukue in the Gotō islands.

106
00:04:16,609 --> 00:04:18,309
Looks like it's a pretty place.

107
00:04:18,309 --> 00:04:21,842
I'm really excited. Wanted to go here for seven years.

108
00:04:21,842 --> 00:04:22,892
I bet it's a manga.

109
00:04:22,892 --> 00:04:25,392
Yeah, Barakamon

110
00:04:25,392 --> 00:04:27,075
Wait, this manga took place here?

111
00:04:27,075 --> 00:04:28,525
You know this manga?!

112
00:04:28,525 --> 00:04:29,075
Yeah, it was very fun!

113
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:33,442
Time to board!

114
00:04:33,442 --> 00:04:35,525
I didn't expect the front to open like this.

115
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:37,342
First time I see a boat open like that.

116
00:04:37,342 --> 00:04:40,292
Yeah. From what I saw, you go in from behind most of the time.

117
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:42,292
Boarding!

118
00:04:42,292 --> 00:04:43,059
Don't slip.

119
00:04:43,059 --> 00:04:43,592
Yeah, yeah.
