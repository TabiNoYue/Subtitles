1
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:13,190
Today is hanami!!! I'm excited!

2
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:15,020
You were this excited?

3
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:17,570
You bet, it's the first time I'm properly seeing one.

4
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:20,100
We can see some but sadly on the other side of the river.

5
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,190
Yeah, but it's already pretty from far away.

6
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:25,250
Ohhhh!

7
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,740
Happy to see some on our side too.

8
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,200
It's already pretty pretty.

9
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,870
Clouds are slowly going away, but I hope it'll get sunny on arrival.

10
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:34,420
Leave it to me! I'm pretty lucky with the weather.

11
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:37,320
That good to hear. Make sure it stays sunny!

12
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,120
Yes sir!

13
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:44,970
First time seeing cherries?

14
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:47,570
I've seen some near my school, but they are sparse.

15
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:50,340
Today we are going to one of the top 100 cherry blossom spot.

16
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,320
I cannot wait.

17
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,890
But the view is already amazing.

18
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:01,990
Oh? We're almost there.

19
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:02,550
Already?

20
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,870
Oh wow! Trees are so close!

21
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:09,470
Indeed, this place is great.

22
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,290
How is it?

23
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:29,050
It's great.

24
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:29,990
That's good to hear.

25
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:35,290
Great, it's open. Can we make a small stop?

26
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:36,070
Okay!

27
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:43,250
Hmmm, hard to take a picture.

28
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:44,840
Maybe change this?

29
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,200
Like this?

30
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,750
Sorry, the other way around.

31
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,920
Ready to go?

32
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,040
Sad to leave but let's go.

33
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:54,220
The road is still going so there still a lot to see.

34
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:54,990
Yay!

35
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:59,520
Thanks for bringing me here.

36
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,470
You are welcome.

37
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:02,990
This road is really pretty...

38
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,420
Look for as long as you want.

39
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:07,020
Sorry, I will probably be silent for a few.

40
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:07,900
It's all good.

41
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:30,740
I've never seen such beautiful cherry blossom back home...

42
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,590
I didn't know there were cherries overseas.

43
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:37,120
There isn't many but a few places have cherries. But many times it's just half a dozen of them.

44
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,090
That's great! You can have a small taste of Japan thanks to those.

45
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:01,420
Back home cherries are often in a small area inside a park.

46
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:04,200
You don't hear much Japanese but you see some cosplays.

47
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,070
There is cosplay oversea too?

48
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:08,920
There is! Not as high quality as Comiket but there is.

49
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:29,000
That was a blast!

50
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,320
Bloody hell...

51
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,020
Ay yo!

52
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,470
It's so pretty here too!

53
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,090
Right?

54
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:35,100
But this place looks very man made.

55
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:35,770
Well yeah.

56
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:38,570
Completely different in style but both have their good!

57
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,340
Been a long time since I came to Minamata.

58
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,550
You already came here?

59
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:52,500
Yeah. It's on the southern edge, and you can use the national road 3 to get here.

60
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,750
I never heard of this place until lately...

61
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:01,150
Hey. Can we make a stop at the museum? Always wanted to come here since I saw that movie.

62
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:03,770
Sure. It's close and I also wanted to visit that place.

63
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:04,440
Thank you.

64
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,490
There were more things than I expected...

65
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:34,840
Yeah. It was larger than I expected.

66
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,750
There was a lot of explanation, and it was very interesting.

67
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,690
I liked how the museum was split in three parts.

68
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:43,550
One for mercury, one for art and one for the events...

69
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:47,040
Yeah. It felt like each parts had a very different atmosphere.

70
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,670
You were walking a bit fast no?

71
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:51,450
Well, I don't like reading a lot...

72
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:54,350
I prefer to see the items rather than reading a wall of text...

73
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:58,340
Ah, I get you. But there were some interesting descriptions.

74
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:02,370
Yeh, that's why I was reading at first when they explain the effects of mercury.

75
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:05,500
Then when it was about the actions from the people, I was barely reading...

76
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,390
I think seeing the items and making a story in your head is more interesting.

77
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:12,100
Sometimes I want to be sure and read the description.

78
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,840
You have a point. This way you can remember things longer.

79
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:18,570
People back then didn't know a lot about those substances.

80
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:21,200
Mercury, lead, radioactive paint...

81
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,870
I cannot believe there is still places that uses such dangerous products.

82
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,790
Many don't really have the choice tho...

83
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:29,750
Now able to pass on one more thing.

84
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,440
Remember them.

85
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,800
Remember they once lived.

86
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,540
There is still plenty of time, want to go somewhere else?

87
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,490
Can we go to the mountain side please?

88
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:43,940
Okay.

89
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:44,600
Thank you.

90
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:49,840
Thanks a lot for today.

91
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,320
Likewise. Completely forgot about hanami.

92
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,520
A friend of mine said you don't go for the view, but for the drinks...

93
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:55,920
Ahh...

94
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,520
Yah, there is people like this...

95
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,670
I see seeking every occasion to drink is an international thing.

96
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,800
Haha, you're right.

97
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,900
It's already this late...

98
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,340
Oh gosh... I don't want to study for exams.

99
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,150
That's sounds hard...

100
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:11,870
Wait, was it ok to go watch the flowers today?

101
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:12,770
It'sallright!

102
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:14,240
I'm already behind schedule.

103
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,490
What did all right ment again...

104
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:22,200
That sounds hard... Good luck!

105
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,670
Thanks! I'll do my best!

106
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,440
Finally done... Now just have to...

107
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,890
Going to explain why it took you so long to post?

108
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:39,390
Well... There is a deep reason. Deeper than the Mariana Trench.

109
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,070
Go on.

110
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:43,190
It tried to create a script for this video but...

111
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:48,720
since I couldn't find it funny, I decided to try other was to create my video.

112
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,570
So weekly post from now on?

113
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:55,000
Weekly is a bit much... But I'll try to post more stuff even if I have to change topic.

114
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,850
Well, you have to make the subtitles two times after all...

115
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:59,850
I first need to have a dialog to make the subtitles.

116
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:01,670
You write scripts you don't use in the end.

117
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:03,370
Ahh, I cannot hear anything!

118
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:08,990
Thanks for all the view and comments for the dating past video.

119
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,190
Comments...

120
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,670
Kind of want to read and not read them...

121
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:14,840
Is there something wrong?

122
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,200
Well, you made me take a specific picture...

123
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,290
C'mon it's going to be all right.

124
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:19,750
You sure?

125
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,040
Thanks for the cheering.

126
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,640
You always smirk to those.

127
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,040
I don't smirk... or do I?

128
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,150
Yay!

129
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:30,520
It's true you see a lot individually, but pretty rare to see mixed up.

130
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,820
400X good!

131
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,200
I guess people are used to hear English nowdays...

132
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,900
Well Maki speaking English is good too.

133
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,440
Don't say silly things and got to the next comment.

134
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,020
Okay okay.

135
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,070
Yeah, why? Have my guess but...

136
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:47,170
Ah, this is a homage to Kureo, a young man appearing in videos made by Okara called SR400 Touring Diary.

137
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:49,400
So this was the Kureo jump... But why?

138
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:54,420
Well, I'm a bit chubby so wanted to do some exercice.

139
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,600
And to train shooting moving object.

140
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,420
You could take birds or trains...

141
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:58,920
...

142
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,990
Didn't think about that...

143
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:03,070
I just make myself small and hide in a pocket.

144
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:04,390
There is no space to sit behind...

145
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,650
It's just some hidden setting.

146
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:06,520
Who's that?

147
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,840
See! Told you people would comment on this.

148
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,600
But this is just a 3 digit number.

149
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,640
I don't know what everyone is on about.

150
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,390
Isthatso...

151
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,520
I'm sorry if it made you uncomfortable.

152
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,340
I didn't try to annoy you. It's just a friendly taunt.

153
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:23,290
Well, it's a must do if you see this number.

154
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:27,470
You seems tiered today, are you alright?

155
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:29,840
Yah I'm okay... Just having a lot of exams lately...

156
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:34,290
Exam, That's a word i didn't hear in a long time... Good luck!

157
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:34,940
I'll!
