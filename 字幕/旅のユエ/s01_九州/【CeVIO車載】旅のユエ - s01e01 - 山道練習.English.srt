00:00:11,992 --> 00:00:13,392
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:13,392 --> 00:00:17,559
If you saw the last record, welcome back. I'm Yue.

3
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:18,525
Maki here.

4
00:00:18,525 --> 00:00:21,309
Going to Aso for the first time since I started riding 2 months ago.

5
00:00:21,309 --> 00:00:23,309
Aso? Didn't it erupt lately?

6
00:00:23,309 --> 00:00:25,775
Today's risk level is 2, we can go to the square.

7
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:26,942
Let’s go!

8
00:00:27,892 --> 00:00:30,575
Road 45, one of my favorite roads.

9
00:00:30,575 --> 00:00:33,592
Nice road indeed but do not go too fast.

10
00:00:33,592 --> 00:00:34,259
Yea, yea.

11
00:00:35,259 --> 00:00:39,092
Went here the day I got the bike. You can definitely feel the seasons here.

12
00:00:39,092 --> 00:00:45,109
Start of October... early fall, now is late fall. I'm sure there was more leaves the first time.

13
00:00:45,109 --> 00:00:47,209
True, but the road is always clean.

14
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:53,309
Looks like a pretty place. Is it famous?

15
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:56,725
Kikuchi gorge. There always is people visiting here.

16
00:00:56,725 --> 00:00:59,925
Ya, it's a bit too clean and unnatural to me...

17
00:00:59,925 --> 00:01:02,275
Indeed, but want to go inside one day.

18
00:01:02,275 --> 00:01:04,075
Looks fun to visit indeed.

19
00:01:07,142 --> 00:01:11,259
By the way, how's your leg? You were injured the last time we met.

20
00:01:11,259 --> 00:01:14,492
It's healing. Not fully but it doesn't hurt anymore.

21
00:01:14,492 --> 00:01:20,392
Happy to hear that. Was a bit worried since you were paying attention to your leg when I went to search you.

22
00:01:20,392 --> 00:01:23,109
Was paying attention so you don't worry…

23
00:01:23,109 --> 00:01:26,692
Be careful. If you get injured again, it will take a long time to heal.

24
00:01:26,692 --> 00:01:28,409
Thanks... I'll be careful.

25
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:37,809
Good thing I asked for a way to reach you after you dropped me at the convenience store.

26
00:01:37,809 --> 00:01:39,859
You surprised me there.

27
00:01:39,859 --> 00:01:42,459
Tried to thank you but you wouldn't listen...

28
00:01:42,459 --> 00:01:44,375
Had to keep a way to reach you...

29
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:46,159
Ain't done anything tho...

30
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,892
Invited you to eat as well...

31
00:01:47,892 --> 00:01:50,692
Sadly I don't want a uni student to treat me.

32
00:01:50,692 --> 00:01:53,425
So why did you keep chatting in English to me?

33
00:01:53,425 --> 00:01:54,009
Hum?

34
00:01:54,325 --> 00:01:57,359
You could ignore me and act as if we didn't meet?

35
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:58,359
Oh, that's easy.

36
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:00,125
Not replying is pretty rude after all.

37
00:02:00,851 --> 00:02:02,159
You too kind.

38
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:02,725
Pardon?

39
00:02:02,725 --> 00:02:06,292
I said, you better think of why you still accept me around.

40
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:09,309
It's kidnapping! One-one-two, call the police!

41
00:02:09,309 --> 00:02:13,209
Nonono, you're the one that asked me to show you around.

42
00:02:13,209 --> 00:02:15,425
Ahhh, someone! Help meeee!

43
00:02:15,425 --> 00:02:19,025
Wait, I've the history of the messages for the past week.

44
00:02:19,025 --> 00:02:28,392
Yesterday you said something like. “I'd like to go to nearby Aso, do you have any recommendation? Can you show me around?”

45
00:02:28,392 --> 00:02:32,392
Or something along those lines.

46
00:02:32,392 --> 00:02:34,942
Uhhh, that's scary... how's your mind working?

47
00:02:34,942 --> 00:02:35,825
That's not scary...

48
00:02:35,825 --> 00:02:39,042
Nah, that's actually scary... Odd actually...

49
00:02:39,042 --> 00:02:41,409
Odd is fine, it what makes me as an individual.

50
00:02:41,409 --> 00:02:45,959
Individuality... actually... that doesn't make you less weird...

51
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:47,825
... Individuality...

52
00:02:47,825 --> 00:02:49,275
Said something weirdo?

53
00:02:49,275 --> 00:02:52,059
You have a very specific trait.

54
00:02:52,059 --> 00:02:53,925
... Are you actually a weirdo?

55
00:02:53,925 --> 00:02:56,775
I found a way for you to thank me. Nothing complicated.

56
00:02:56,775 --> 00:02:59,809
As long as you are in the region, call me when you want to visit a remote place.

57
00:02:59,809 --> 00:03:01,325
In exchange, speak English to me.

58
00:03:01,325 --> 00:03:02,025
... Wha?

59
00:03:02,025 --> 00:03:07,225
Want to practice my listening. Once we get used you speak in Japanese while I speak English.

60
00:03:07,225 --> 00:03:07,959
… That's it?

61
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:08,675
That's it.

62
00:03:08,675 --> 00:03:10,859
It's not enough... you're at a loss...

63
00:03:10,859 --> 00:03:15,609
It's equivalent. If you and I are good with the trade then it's equivalent.

64
00:03:16,275 --> 00:03:16,925
… thanks.

65
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:23,892
Checked that we can go to the plaza at roadside station Aso.

66
00:03:23,892 --> 00:03:25,709
It's pretty cold up there so make sure to layer up.

67
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:27,975
I'll put this raincoat like no one ever had.

68
00:03:29,775 --> 00:03:33,409
Your side bags are in the way, so I made myself small…

69
00:03:33,409 --> 00:03:34,542
Uh, how?

70
00:03:34,542 --> 00:03:35,709
It's a secret!

71
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:37,509
Yaya, smug all you want.

72
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:39,675
What do they keep here?

73
00:03:39,675 --> 00:03:41,009
Maybe cows or horses?

74
00:03:41,009 --> 00:03:44,342
Since it's November, I think they went down.

75
00:03:44,342 --> 00:03:45,192
It's lovely.

76
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:46,975
Cow… Like Akaushi?

77
00:03:46,975 --> 00:03:48,325
Most likely yeah.

78
00:03:48,325 --> 00:03:49,359
Dunno?

79
00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:50,159
Dunno.

80
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,642
We're a bit short on time this time,

81
00:03:52,642 --> 00:03:56,259
Akagyudon (red beef bowl), barbecue... Have to lookup.

82
00:03:56,342 --> 00:03:59,775
If possible nothing too extreme. I'm a student remember?

83
00:03:59,775 --> 00:04:02,792
It’s ok. I know where to go (the internet).

84
00:04:06,525 --> 00:04:09,359
It's getting chilly. You ok?

85
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:10,625
It's warm in here.

86
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:11,675
That's good to hear.

87
00:04:12,675 --> 00:04:18,359
A mesh jacket with a few layers in fine for now but gotta lookup for some winter jacket and gloves soon.

88
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:21,375
As a student I'm broke so nothing expensive ok?

89
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,342
I see that's common for all countries.

90
00:04:23,342 --> 00:04:26,442
It's ok, I'll lookup for a warm windproof pouch.

91
00:04:26,442 --> 00:04:28,992
Thank you. I'm not against used gear.

92
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:32,042
Finally arrived and it's cold!

93
00:04:32,042 --> 00:04:35,209
Was expecting worse but the wind sure is cold...

94
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,942
When you feel cold there is only one thing to do!

95
00:04:37,942 --> 00:04:38,825
Eat an ice-cream.

96
00:04:38,825 --> 00:04:40,775
... Are you actually an idiot?

97
00:04:40,775 --> 00:04:43,475
Cannot miss this. And don't you say you get warm after eating?

98
00:04:43,475 --> 00:04:47,792
Never heard anything like that... Not sure if it works for cold food...

99
00:04:49,792 --> 00:04:51,025
Well, time to go back.

100
00:04:51,025 --> 00:04:52,842
Okie dokie, anytime.

101
00:04:57,092 --> 00:04:59,259
Don't you get tiered in that mini form?

102
00:04:59,259 --> 00:05:03,109
Nope. Actually it's easier, but I cannot do anything like this.

103
00:05:03,109 --> 00:05:06,059
Good to hear. Enjoy the scenery.

104
00:05:07,059 --> 00:05:12,559
Isn’t there a small scratch and shock proof pouch that could act as an airbag?

105
00:05:14,559 --> 00:05:15,992
Oh? Maybe…

106
00:05:15,992 --> 00:05:16,642
What is?

107
00:05:16,642 --> 00:05:18,225
Wait and see.

108
00:05:22,175 --> 00:05:22,925
Sunset!

109
00:05:22,925 --> 00:05:24,609
It sure looks like it.

110
00:05:26,609 --> 00:05:29,042
I thought she’d a bit more surprised.

111
00:05:31,859 --> 00:05:36,225
But we must catch the sun back, or it's going to be dark and cold.

112
00:05:36,225 --> 00:05:37,992
Just a bit, almost there.

113
00:05:40,992 --> 00:05:41,609
Sunrise!

114
00:05:41,609 --> 00:05:43,592
Yaya, very funny.

115
00:05:43,592 --> 00:05:45,042
Why do you know this expression?

116
00:05:45,042 --> 00:05:46,825
Hehe, Who knows?

117
00:05:53,109 --> 00:05:55,775
But it sure is nice to go down like this.

118
00:05:55,775 --> 00:05:58,742
The sun is in the eyes, but the view is really pretty.

119
00:05:58,742 --> 00:06:01,225
No wonder we call this time golden hour.

120
00:06:01,225 --> 00:06:03,625
Taking nice pictures is easier around this time.

121
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:06,925
Indeed but it can be tricky in some situations.

122
00:06:06,925 --> 00:06:07,592
For example?

123
00:06:07,592 --> 00:06:10,759
Since the is less light, and red tone color are stronger.

124
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:13,925
And the low sun may be in the way for some angles.

125
00:06:13,925 --> 00:06:16,425
Playing with the light sure is complicated...

126
00:06:16,842 --> 00:06:17,959
You know a lot.

127
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:21,625
Not really, just been around someone loving his photography.

128
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:26,342
Is that so... I have another one you can use anytime.

129
00:06:26,342 --> 00:06:28,109
Thanks but not right now.

130
00:06:30,859 --> 00:06:33,275
Wait, is this, making a small detour.

131
00:06:33,275 --> 00:06:34,092
'kay!

132
00:06:37,092 --> 00:06:39,325
Oh wow, this place is very pretty.

133
00:06:43,742 --> 00:06:44,509
Want to try?

134
00:06:44,509 --> 00:06:47,575
Nah I'm good, but maybe you want to be in the picture?

135
00:06:47,575 --> 00:06:49,342
I can take you if you want.

136
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:52,409
Ahhh, I prefer to be taken only when needed.

137
00:06:52,409 --> 00:06:53,625
Now isn't the time?

138
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:55,925
Not now. How about you? Want to be in?

139
00:06:55,925 --> 00:06:57,592
I'm pretty much the same.

140
00:06:57,592 --> 00:07:01,625
I don't think framing a moment of someone is necessary most of the time.

141
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:04,975
That's why I mostly take videos when I'm with someone.

142
00:07:04,975 --> 00:07:05,709
I feel you.

143
00:07:05,709 --> 00:07:07,992
But don't take me too much ok?

144
00:07:07,992 --> 00:07:09,425
Is that an invitation?

145
00:07:09,425 --> 00:07:10,209
No, it's not!

146
00:07:14,159 --> 00:07:15,325
Time to go I guess.

147
00:07:15,325 --> 00:07:16,692
Gyungyun ikuyo!

148
00:07:16,692 --> 00:07:17,259
Let's go!

149
00:07:22,725 --> 00:07:26,342
Late greeting but happy new year.

150
00:07:26,342 --> 00:07:27,875
Happy new year indeed.

151
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:29,775
It kind of is February tho.

152
00:07:29,775 --> 00:07:33,342
Well, it’s the first record of the year. Cannot help it.

153
00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:36,109
Have to find a name for this part...

154
00:07:36,109 --> 00:07:41,209
It's only you and me recording voices at a cafe, so part c is fine I guess?

155
00:07:41,209 --> 00:07:44,892
There isn't a lot of noise for something recorded in public.

156
00:07:44,892 --> 00:07:46,792
You can thank my edit skills.

157
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:50,859
Thank you for the views on YouTube.

158
00:07:50,859 --> 00:07:53,525
I didn't see many views on the YouTube side.

159
00:07:53,525 --> 00:07:55,709
Well… couldn’t promote it too much…

160
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:58,409
Maybe I should spread it with “Yay! Maki is kawaii”…

161
00:07:58,409 --> 00:07:59,425
Please don't…

162
00:07:59,925 --> 00:08:00,492
Moving on,

Can you react to some comments from NicoNico?

164
00:08:06,359 --> 00:08:08,975
I mean it's better than talking about the weather.

165
00:08:08,975 --> 00:08:09,892
Are you hitting on me?

166
00:08:09,892 --> 00:08:11,425
Who knows?

167
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:15,459
Yah… but was too busy trying to climb that hill...

168
00:08:16,459 --> 00:08:18,625
Please don't get into any trouble (this is fiction).

169
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:20,792
Is that ok?

170
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:23,575
Perfect, I think it’ll be fun to watch.

171
00:08:24,025 --> 00:08:29,759
I learn new ways to edit so I hope I’ll get used to editing and posting.

172
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,325
Please look forward to the next record.

173
00:08:32,325 --> 00:08:35,759
Well see you on the next record until then take care.

174
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:36,792
See you.

175
00:08:38,259 --> 00:08:42,425
Ah, a message from Aoi. She angry because there was no narration…

176
00:08:43,209 --> 00:08:47,375
I wonder if there is narration next time. Ah, there is this question from you.
